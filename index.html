<h1 style="color:Dodgerblue;">About me</h1>
                                                            <p>Who am i?.</p>
<ul>
    <li>My name majd loulou</li>
    <li>I am 21 years old from Nazareth,Israel</li>
    
<h2 style="color:#ff0000;">The question is why did i apply for this program?</h2>
<p>Since i graduated from highschool i always woundered what would i become?!. 
would a i be an engineer?,doctor?,lawyer? or even a working guy ? (line carpenter,plummer...etc).
i felt lost,confused and sometimes even hopeless... .
one day i wass sitting with a friend drinking a coffee in the weekend... we were actually good friend (and still) 
at the time my friend was doing quite well for himself,a nice car for his age, elegant clothing, a luxury watch, so i knew his occupation was digital marketing so i asked him if it is a worthwhile investment to make to learn the subject( if its worth the money and time)
so he reccomended it to me and i started my journey to the digital marketing world ! so i spent almost a year of my time and a respectable amount of money to learn the subject, and suddenly... i found the right subject for me ! it was intresting sometimes i felt that it was actually fun to do ! and for some reason i was a natural at it (lucky me).
o finished the program succefully and started to do the real thing ! boy it was fun, until... i found out there is more to it... it wasnt just to use a Content management system and that's it... when i saw what could be made with javascript coding was just astonishing !
i started to get curious about javascript... i didnt have any previous expirience with coding what so ever... and still not expirienced, but, i just discovered a new world, hopefully you guys will help me conquer it, because where is will there is a path.
